put your cert & key in 'pem'

cat pem | ./daisyd

this is currently hard coded to listen on :5000 and proxy to httpd on localhost at 127.128.129.1:80. it probably only works on intel & Linux.

by works i mean basically works with bugs, look out for orphaned & spinning processes if testing :)

POA structure & clean up, maybe add redirect rewrite.
