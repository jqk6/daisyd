simple forking ssl terminating proxy which was the last homework from an openssl class.

put your cert & key in 'pem'

cat pem | ./daisyd

hard coded to listen on *:5000 and proxy to an httpd on localhost at 127.128.129.1:80. 

it probably only works on Intel & Linux, and assuming a pretty loose definition of works! seems to go terribly wrong somehow under much load. just a proof of concept.
